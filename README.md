StatsForGamers is an ongoing personal project exploring WebAssembly, with the goal of developing a WebApp that gamifies statistics. 
This early prototype was made using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), and only has a tab for a rudimentary hypergeometric calculator.
The next immediate steps in the project involve adding more functions and testing their performance across different WebAssembly technologies.
